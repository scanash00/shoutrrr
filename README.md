## What is Shoutrrr?

Shoutrrr is a social media scheduling tool you run yourself. Connect your accounts, draft a post once, and send it to every network at the same time — or queue it to go out on a recurring schedule. No monthly seat fees, no third party holding your tokens or your data.

It's built for individuals and teams: invite collaborators into a shared workspace, keep clients or brands separated, and see how your posts perform — all from a single, fast interface.

## Why Shoutrrr?

- **You own everything** — your posts, your audience tokens, your analytics. Self-hosted on your infrastructure.
- **One post, every platform** — compose once and publish to multiple accounts, tweaking the text per network when you want.
- **Plan ahead** — a posting queue with recurring time slots and a month calendar, so your feed stays consistent without you babysitting it.
- **Made for teams** — workspaces, roles, and email invites keep clients and collaborators tidy.
- **No vendor lock-in** — open source under the Apache 2.0 license, runs anywhere Docker does.

## Supported platforms

| Platform        | Connect with     | Publishing                          | Threads         | Analytics                            |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **X** (Twitter) | OAuth 2.0        | ✅ (≤280 chars, up to 4 media)      | ✅              | likes, reposts, replies, impressions |
| **Bluesky**     | App password     | ✅ (≤300 graphemes, up to 4 images) | ✅              | likes, reposts, replies              |
| **LinkedIn**    | OAuth 2.0 (OIDC) | ✅ (≤3000 chars, up to 9 images)    | — (single post) | engagement metrics                   |

## Features

- 📝 **Composer** — draft with media and alt text, see a live character count for each network, and automatically split long posts into threads where the platform supports it.
- 🚀 **Multi-account publishing** — fan one post out to many accounts at once, with optional per-platform overrides. Each target publishes independently and retries on failure.
- 🗓️ **Queue & calendar** — set recurring posting slots (in your workspace's timezone), drop drafts into the queue, and review everything on a month calendar. Publish instantly whenever you like.
- 📊 **Analytics** — follower and post-count trends per account, plus per-post engagement (likes, reposts, replies, impressions).
- 🔗 **Connected accounts** — link accounts via OAuth (X, LinkedIn) or app password (Bluesky), group them into reusable sets, and get nudged when one needs reconnecting. Tokens are stored encrypted and refreshed automatically.
- 👥 **Workspaces & team** — multiple workspaces with role-based memberships, email invitations, and ownership transfer. Every bit of data is scoped to its workspace.
- 🔔 **Notifications** — in-app alerts when a post publishes or fails, or when an account needs attention.
- 🔐 **Secure by default** — email/password with verification, two-factor (TOTP), passkeys (WebAuthn), and optional social login (Google, X, LinkedIn).

## Self-hosting

The recommended way to host Shoutrrr is the prebuilt Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/coollabsio/shoutrrr:latest
```

The image runs the web app, queue worker, and scheduler in one container — ideal for a single box. It defaults to SQLite with no external services, and you can switch to Postgres/Redis later if you need to scale out.

### Quick start with `docker run`

Create a production env file:

```bash
cat > .env.prod <<'EOF'
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=http://localhost:8080
APP_PORT=8080
APP_KEY=base64:PASTE_GENERATED_KEY_HERE

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite

CACHE_STORE=database
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
SESSION_DRIVER=database
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=false

QUEUE_WORKER_ENABLED=true
SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true
INERTIA_SSR_ENABLED=false
EOF
```

Generate an `APP_KEY` and paste it into `.env.prod`:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint php ghcr.io/coollabsio/shoutrrr:latest /var/www/html/artisan key:generate --show
```

Start Shoutrrr with persistent volumes:

```bash
docker volume create shoutrrr-storage
docker volume create shoutrrr-sqlite

docker run -d \
  --name shoutrrr \
  --env-file .env.prod \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v shoutrrr-storage:/var/www/html/storage \
  -v shoutrrr-sqlite:/var/www/html/database/sqlite \
  ghcr.io/coollabsio/shoutrrr:latest
```

Shoutrrr runs its startup tasks automatically, including database migrations. Open `http://localhost:8080`, register the first account, and you're in.

For a real public deployment, set `APP_URL` to your HTTPS domain and set `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`. To test a specific release candidate, replace `latest` with a version tag such as `1.0.0-rc.2` in the commands above.


To reset all local test data:

```bash
docker rm -f shoutrrr
docker volume rm shoutrrr-storage shoutrrr-sqlite
```

### Docker Compose

If you prefer Compose, use the bundled production file. It pulls the prebuilt image from GHCR (`ghcr.io/coollabsio/shoutrrr:latest`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coollabsio/shoutrrr.git
cd shoutrrr
cp .env.example.prod .env

# Set APP_KEY and APP_URL in .env before starting.
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yaml run --rm app php artisan key:generate --show

docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yaml up -d
```

Shoutrrr runs its startup tasks automatically, including database migrations. `docker-compose.development.yaml` builds the image locally from source instead.

Set `INERTIA_SSR_ENABLED=true` for server-side rendering. To run the worker/scheduler as separate services in the cloud, set `QUEUE_WORKER_ENABLED=false` / `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false` and override the container command (e.g. `php artisan queue:work`).

### Deploy with Coolify

[Coolify](https://coolify.io) deploys Shoutrrr straight from this repo using the bundled Compose file — it handles the domain, HTTPS, and persistent volumes for you.

> An official Shoutrrr app is coming to the Coolify app directory soon for one-click deploys. Until then, use the manual from-source method below.

1. In Coolify, click **+ New → Resource** and pick **Public Repository** (or Private, via the GitHub App). Enter `https://github.com/coollabsio/shoutrrr`.
2. Set the **Build Pack** to **Docker Compose** and the **Docker Compose file** to `docker-compose.production.yaml`.
3. Under the `app` service, add a **Domain** pointing at port **8080**. Coolify provisions the TLS certificate automatically.
4. Add these **Environment Variables**:

   | Variable | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `APP_KEY` | a Laravel key — generate one with `php artisan key:generate --show` |
   | `APP_URL` | your domain, e.g. `https://social.example.com` (must match the domain above) |
   | `APP_ENV` | `production` |
   | `APP_DEBUG` | `false` |

   Add your `X_*`, `LINKEDIN_*`, and optional `GOOGLE_*` credentials here too (see [Connecting your accounts](#connecting-your-accounts)).
5. Click **Deploy**.

The Compose file declares named volumes for `storage` and the SQLite database, so your data and uploads survive redeploys. To run against managed Postgres/Redis instead, point the `DB_*` / `REDIS_*` env vars at them and switch `DB_CONNECTION`, `CACHE_STORE`, and `QUEUE_CONNECTION` accordingly.

### Security headers & Content-Security-Policy

Outside `local`, Shoutrrr sends a strict, nonce-based **Content-Security-Policy** along with `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and (in production) `Strict-Transport-Security`. This is deliberate hardening — but if you customise the frontend or front the app with an unusual proxy/CDN, it's the first place to look when something renders wrong.

**If the UI loads unstyled or a feature is broken, open your browser's dev console and check for CSP violations.** Common causes and fixes (all in `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeaders.php`):

- **Assets served from a different origin than `APP_URL`** (e.g. a CDN host) are blocked by `default-src 'self'`. Serve built assets from the app origin, or add the host to `script-src`/`style-src`/`img-src`.
- **Third-party embeds or analytics scripts** are blocked — `script-src` only trusts the app's own nonced scripts (`'strict-dynamic'`). Add the source explicitly if you need it.
- **Images/avatars from arbitrary hosts** are allowed (`img-src` permits `https:`); tighten this if you prefer.

The CSP is intentionally **not** sent in `local` (`APP_ENV=local`) because it is incompatible with the Vite dev server's hot-reload. To verify the production policy locally, run a build and serve with a non-local env (`bun run build && APP_ENV=production php artisan serve`). Note that `Strict-Transport-Security` requires the app to be served over HTTPS.

## Connecting your accounts

**Bluesky** needs nothing extra — users connect with a Bluesky [app password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords).

**X** and **LinkedIn** publish through your own developer app, so you'll register one with each provider and add the credentials to `.env`. The redirect URIs must match what you register (they default to `${APP_URL}/...`):

```dotenv
# X — https://developer.x.com
X_CLIENT_ID=
X_CLIENT_SECRET=
X_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/x"

# LinkedIn — https://www.linkedin.com/developers
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=
LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/linkedin"
```

Optionally, let people sign in with a social account instead of a password:

```dotenv
SOCIALITE_ENABLED=true
SOCIALITE_PROVIDERS=google            # comma-separated: google,x,linkedin
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/auth/google/callback"
```

> **Heads up:** publishing and scheduling rely on a running queue worker and scheduler. The provided Docker setups start both for you. Analytics capture is off until you enable `metrics.enabled` (see `config/metrics.php`).

## Development

Shoutrrr is a Laravel 13 (PHP 8.5) app with a React 19 + TypeScript frontend on [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) v3, [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). It runs on [Laravel Octane](https://laravel.com/docs/octane) (FrankenPHP), with typed routes generated by [Wayfinder](https://github.com/laravel/wayfinder).

```bash
composer setup   # install deps, copy .env, generate key, migrate, bun install, build assets
composer dev     # serve + queue + scheduler + logs + Vite, all at once
```

> Uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) for the frontend (`bun install`, `bun run …`) — not npm/pnpm.

### How publishing works

A post is composed once, then split into one **target** per connected account. The scheduler dispatches due posts every minute; a queued `PublishPostTarget` job then publishes each target independently, with retries, idempotency, and a per-attempt audit trail. Hourly jobs refresh OAuth tokens before they expire, and (when enabled) metrics are captured every 15 minutes.
